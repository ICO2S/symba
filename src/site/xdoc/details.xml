                This page describes technical details of SyMBA.
            </p>

            <p>
                SyMBA is available to play with and test in a
                <a href="http://www.cisban.ac.uk/symba-sandbox">public sandbox version</a>.
                Please note that the configuration at this url, while representing the current stable release, remains a
                sandbox configuration, and any data you upload to the server may be viewed by SyMBA developers or may
                be deleted at any time, without warning. We will, however, try to send out warning emails prior to any
                deletion of the database. As a sandbox implementation, it should not be used as a
                permanent archive for any data. If you wish to have an archive to store your high-throughput data,
                please
                <a href="mailto:symba-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a>
                to see if we could collaborate in any way.

            <subsection name="Logging In">

                <p>
                    There is now a general, all-purpose login to the sandbox (test) installation. The username is
                    'Anonymous' and the pass is 'AnonymousPass'. Please feel free to use this account, and please send an
                    email to <a href="mailto:symba-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">the SyMBA developer's list</a>
                    if something is wrong with the account. However, if you want your own space, then please contact the
                    same mailing list to request it.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="What we mean by a 'sandbox' release">

                <p>
                    The sandbox installation is a playground, and includes a few example experimental templates for
                    you to play with. It is just an area where you can test the SyMBA web interface. However, the
                    web interface is only a small part of the SyMBA project, and we encourage you to checkout
                    the project from subversion (<a href="source-repository.html">here's how</a>) and have a more
                    thorough look at it. This is not meant to be a large-scale repository, and may only have a few
                    experiments in it at any one time, as we are constantly re-building the sandbox to reflect the
                    latest changes to the codebase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to stop and restart the SyMBA server at any time, and to drop and re-create the
                    database at any time. You should not attempt to use this service as a long-term, permanent store.
                    However, we encourage you to upload data and create as many experiments as you like
                    so that you may determine if this application may be of use to your own research group. We also
                    appreciate you
                    <a href="mailto:symba-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">contacting us</a>
                    with any comments or questions you may have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Further, although we do have an LSID Resolution Service running via
                    <a href="http://metagenome.ncl.ac.uk:8081/authority">http://metagenome.ncl.ac.uk:8081/authority</a>
                    , and we do aim to ensure that object returned will always return the same thing, not every object
                    identified with an LSID can currently be resolved via this service. This is still within the
                    standard: if something resolves, it must always be to the same thing. However, you are free to test
                    the LSID server now. More information on contacting the LSID Resolution Service will be added
                    shortly, together with an example Java class.

                Our back-end, and the XML produced by the front-end, is completely
                <a href="http://fuge.sourceforge.net">FuGE-compliant</a>.
                CISBAN is part of the
                <a href="http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/rsbi/rsbi.html">RSBI Consortium</a>,
                which
                encourages the use of three main reporting standards
                for biological investigations:
                <a href="http://fuge.sourceforge.net">FuGE</a>,
                <a href="http://obi.sourceforge.net">OBI</a>,
                and
                <a href="http://mibbi.sourceforge.net">MIBBI</a>.
                FuGE is a maturing standard data model for storing experimental metadata, OBI is a developing standard
                ontology for biological/biomedical experiments, and MIBBI is a new effort to standardize the minimum
                information needed to describe a biological experiment.

        <section name="What does the release number mean?">

            <p>
                We have based the release numbering system on the
                <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>
                style. This means that the number prefixing the "." is the year of the release, and the number after
                the "." is the month of the release. Therefore, release 7.03 was released in March 2007. Finally, we add
                a comment after the release number detailing whether the release is a beta version or a stable version.
            </p>

        <section name="Does this project suit your needs?">

            <p>
                We are interested in collaboration with any group that may be able to make use of this project. Most
                aspects of the application are generic, and the main way of customizing SyMBA is via creation and
                upload of your own experimental protocols.
