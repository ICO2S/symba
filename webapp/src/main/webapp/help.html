<a name="intro"><h2 class="centered">Introduction to SyMBA</h2></a>

<p>
    The Centre for Integrated Systems Biology of Ageing and Nutrition (CISBAN) has developed a Data Archive and
    Integrator
    (SyMBA) that is based on the FuGE Object Model (FuGE-OM) and which archives, stores, and retrieves
    raw high-throughput data. Until now, few published systems have successfully integrated multiple omics
    investigation detailss and information about experiments in a single database. SyMBA is the first published
    implementation of FuGE that includes a database back-end, expert and standard interfaces, and utilizes a
    Life Science Identifier (LSID) Resolution and Assigning service to identify objects and provide programmatic
    access to the database. Having a central data repository prevents deletion, loss, or accidental modification
    of primary data, while giving convenient access to the data for publication and analysis. It also provides a
    central location for storage of metadata for the high-throughput data sets, and will facilitate subsequent
    data integration strategies.

<p>
    By restricting access to SyMBA, we ensure that our data is kept private until we are ready
    to release it. Further, once SyMBA knows who you are, it can easily retrieve experimental
    information and data sets owned by you, as well as automatically assign your name to data files
    you have uploaded. Once logged in, a session specific to you is begun and
    <em>will remain available until you log out or the session times out</em>.

<p>
    Once you have successfully logged on, you will be presented with your home page. From this page you can
    choose to do a variety of tasks, mainly centred around deposition and modification of data files and experimental
    information. Your choices are:
</p>

            <strong>Deposit some Data.</strong> By following this link, you will be presented with a short series
            of web pages that prompt you to deposit your data and add a few relevant bits of information about
            the data file. Any primary data source as described in the CISBAN Data Policy
            (username and password required) may be loaded into SyMBA. By storing our primary data here, we can
            help prevent deletion, loss, or accidental modification of primary data, while giving convenient
            access to the data for publication and analysis. Further, by providing extra information on
            experimental conditions and protocols can provide useful when either viewing or searching for
            specific data files, or when using the data files as input in further research projects.

<p>
    Keeping up-to-date information about each of us is important for our research. Not only should the correct
    person (or people) be associated with each data file and experiment that they were a part of, but each
    change to the information about an experiment should be recorded: not just the time the change was made,
    but also who performed the change. Finally, if we ever need to contact you about your experiment(s), a valid
    email address, phone number or address is important.
</p>

<p>
    Each text box on this page is pre-filled with the information currently held by SyMBA. In this way, you
    can examine your information and change only those items that are incorrect or incomplete. <em>If you have
    not made any changes,</em> pressing "Cancel" will return you to the home page. <em>If you have made
    changes,</em> pressing "Enter" will store your changes in SyMBA.

<p>
    Upon reaching this screen, you have successfully updated your personal details. This confirmation page shows
    you the changes you have just made in blue, and gives you the opportunity to either "Confirm" the changes and
    return to your home page or to "Change" what you've just entered. For more information on why it is important
    for SyMBA to have complete and up-to-date personal information for each of its users, please see the

<a name="search"><h2 class="centered">Search SyMBA</h2></a>

<p>
    SyMBA currently has only one built-in search. However, these are simple to implement and more will be added
    over time. If you have any recommendations or suggestions as to the type of search you would like to perform,
    please <a href="mailto:helpdesk@cisban.ac.uk">contact us</a>. The current search, run when you press the
    "Show All" button, will show you a summary view of all of the experiments currently associated with you.

<a name="whatIsAnExperiment"><h2 class="centered">What is Considered a SyMBA Experiment?</h2></a>

<p>
    When you are adding data to SyMBA, you will see "Experiment" used as a container for your data files.
    But what is an experiment in the context of SyMBA, and how do your data files relate to it? A SyMBA experiment
    is an overarching investigation that may contain many data files, of multiple investigation detailss. For instance,
    if you are performing a large-scale experiment that will involve many microarray results as well as colony growth
    images and 2D-gels, you do not have to create an experiment for each investigation details. Instead, create just one
    experiment and add as many data files and investigation detailss as required. If you do not see a investigation details that is correct
    for you, or the investigation details does not provide the correct identifying factors for your experiment (e.g. you are using
    different strains in your experiment than the ones in SyMBA), then please
    <a href="mailto:helpdesk@cisban.ac.uk">contact us</a>.

<a name="newOrExist"><h2 class="centered">Choosing Between a New or Existing Experiment for Your Data File</h2></a>

<p>
    Choosing whether the data files you are about to deposit are part of an experiment you have already told SyMBA
    about, or are part of an experiment not described to SyMBA before is the first step in the process of
    providing SyMBA with experimental information. Just click on the answer appropriate for your situation. You
    will be given the opportunity to either create a new experiment or select an existing experiment depending
    on your answer here. It is important that you associate data files to the correct experiment: not
    only will it help you organize your data files, it will also help others understand the full development
    and scope of your experiment. Erroneous associations could lead to lost data files (i.e. you wouldn't know where
    you put them) or incorrect conclusions about the data. For information and help on what the
    SyMBA considers an experiment, please visit the

    <strong>Important information about the Submission Process:</strong><br>
    Your current stage in the submission process can be tracked in the top portion of this series of web pages.
    Simply clicking on your choice of new or existing experiment will take you to
    the next stage of the submission process. If you leave the submission process <em>at any stage before
    the final confirmation screen,</em> you may loose all your work and have to re-submit. If you have
    any questions or concerns, please <a href="mailto:helpdesk@cisban.ac.uk">contact us</a>.

<p>
    At this stage you are presented with a list of experiments you have already created within the archive.
    Please select the one appropriate for your new data file. For information and help on what the

    Your current stage in the submission process can be tracked in the top portion of this series of web pages.
    Once you have associated the correct protocol to each data file you have just uploaded, press "Submit" to
    continue to the next stage of the submission process. Please press "Submit" only once. Pressing "Back" will
    take you to the page you were on before this one. If you leave the submission process<em> at any stage before

<a name="newExperiment"><h2 class="centered">Creating a New Experiment</h2></a>

<p>
    At this early stage of the data input process, either you have indicated that you wish to create a new
    experiment (by clicking on "a new experiment" when asked if you wish to use an existing experiment or create
    a new one), or SyMBA knows you have not yet created an experiment. For information and help on what the
    SyMBA considers an experiment, please visit the
    "<a href="#whatIsAnExperiment">What is considered a SyMBA Experiment?</a>" help section.
</p>

<p>
    This page is asking for three things: an experiment name, a hypothesis and a conclusion. Only the
    experiment name is required. The experiment name is a phrase that is relevant to you and which describes the
    experiment. It can be as short or as long as you like, and does not have to be unique with your other experiment
    names. This name will be used by SyMBA to refer to this experiment, so you may want it to be memorable.
    The other two fields may be added now, or left blank. Future implementations of SyMBA will allow you to
    re-edit these fields.

<a name="rawData"><h2 class="centered">Depositing Data Files</h2></a>

<p>
    The deposition of data files is the third step in the process of providing SyMBA with experimental
    information. While you are allowed to deposit as many data files as you like at this stage, each data file must be
    of the same type (e.g. Microarray). If you have multiple files of different investigation detailss, then please go through
    the data deposition process once per investigation details. This restriction allows only those experimental processes
    (also known as protocols) to be chosen that are appropriate for the data file during the next stage of the
    submission process. Additionally, all data files deposited at this stage <strong>WILL</strong> be associated
    with the same experiment. Therefore, if you are depositing data files from different experiments, then
    please go through the data deposition process once per experiment.

<a name="protocol"><h2 class="centered">Selecting a Protocol for Your Data File</h2></a>

<p>
    The association of each data file with a protocol is the final step in the process of providing SyMBA
    with experimental information. Each data file is the result of a measurement of one of your experimental
    materials. We need to join together each data file with the exact procedure that was used to generate it.
    On this page is a list of all of the data files you uploaded in the previous page. Each data file name
    has, next to it, a list of appropriate protocols for the investigation details. These protocols were created in
    the database with the consultation of the research groups within CISBAN, and are only useful in that context.
    If your protocol is not present, or if you find an error or lack of important information, then please
    <a href="mailto:helpdesk@cisban.ac.uk">contact us</a>.

    At this stage, your experimental data will have been stored in the archive. Before you continue, please
    click on the "Download" button to download your file from the database. This is CISBAN policy, though
    it may seem counter-intuitive. The reason we require that you download your file is so the CISBAN identifier
    that has been generated for your data file can be automatically attached. It is very important that you
    keep this CISBAN identifier with its associated data file.
    For more information on why this is important, please see
    the section of this help entitled
    "<a href="#cisbanIdentifiers">What is the Identifier that Gets Assigned to My Data File?</a>".

<a name="cisbanIdentifiers"><h2 class="centered">What is the Identifier that Gets Assigned to My Data File?</h2></a>

<p>
    When you upload a data file to SyMBA, in many other areas of the website it is referred to with an identifier
    that will look something like this:
</p>
<p class="bigger">
    Gre_MCA_0365
</p>
<p>
    An identifier like this has been created to uniquely identify each one of your archived data files. When you finish
    the loading process, you will be prompted to download the file you just provided. Doing this means you get back
    a version of your file with this identifier as the filename. Any time you download one of your data files
    from SyMBA, it will be named using this identifier. Keep track of this identifier, as it will
    allow you to absolutely identifiy your data file on your local computer with the one in the database.
</p>
<p>
    This identifier is created in the following manner:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The first 3 characters are the first three characters of your last name.
        </li>
        <li>
            The next 3 characters (after the first underscore, "_") are a three-letter acronym that stands for
            the type of data the identifier belongs to. For example, "MCA" means Microarray.
        </li>
        <li>
            The final 4 characters (after the second underscore) are a set of 4 random digits.
        </li>
    </ol>
