Welcome to the Systems and Molecular Biology data Archive (SyMBA)!
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is based on (and is an extension of) the FuGE Version 1 XSD and Hibernate STKs,
available at http://fuge.sourceforge.net/stks/xsd-stk/index.html and
http://fuge.sourceforge.net/stks/hibernate-stk/index.html . Large amounts of additions were made to generate SyMBA,
together with a more restricted set of changes and additions to the FuGE-OM itself.
