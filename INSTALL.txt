Installation Instructions for the SyMBA
--------------------------------------------

There is a minimal amount of setup of your environment to get it ready for your own installation of SyMBA.
These instructions are available on the SyMBA website, where you may view the HTML or download the PDF versions, at:

http://symba.sourceforge.net/symba-books/installation/index.html

You may also generate the documentation locally. Go into the symba-books directory, and run

mvn doxia:render-books
mvn site:site

Then you will be able to view the HTML generated from these commands. Point your browser to the symba-books/target/site
directory, and open index.html to get you started.

Please direct any questions, comments, or suggestions to symba-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
