Installing a Supported Database

                You must choose a database supported by Hibernate. Databases used in the creation of SyMBA
                include PostgreSQL and MySQL. SyMBA has been extensively tested on PostgreSQL and less extensively
                tested on MySQL.

* PostgreSQL

                    You can download PostgreSQL from their website at
                    {{{http://www.postgresql.org/download/}http://www.postgresql.org/download/}}.
                    <<It is the recommended database, and these instructions use PostgreSQL>>. It is not
                    required, but it is recommended that you also install a graphical
                    database browser such as pgAdminIII or PhpPgAdmin, both available from
                    the url above. The JDBC driver should come with the download. Alternatively the PostgreSQL jdbc
                    driver can be downloaded from
                    {{{http://jdbc.postgresql.org/}http://jdbc.postgresql.org/}}

* MySQL

                You can download MySQL from their website at
                {{{http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/}http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/}}.
                phpMyAdmin
                ({{{http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php}http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php}}) is
                suggested as the GUI for MySQL. If using MySQL, the jdbc driver can be
                downloaded at:
                {{{http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/3.1.html}http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/3.1.html}}
