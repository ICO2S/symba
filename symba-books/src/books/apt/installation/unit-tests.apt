 Unit Tests with Maven

 There are a number of unit tests already available with this STK, and more are planned. These tests are currently
 limited to the symba-mapping and symba-querying sub-projects, and can be found within that directory. Tests are
 disabled by default within the default (local) profile and within the production profile so that production databases
 are not accidentally modified with test data.

 You should run the tests <after> re-running the Maven install command with the correct profile, thus ensuring that
 the database connection details are the right ones for the test setup.

 To run the tests, simply run <<<mvn install>>> from the top-level directory. The default profile is the test
 profile, and all tests will be run during the install process. If you wish to skip tests, <<<mvn install -DskipTests>>>
 can be used. If you wish to run a specific set of tests, then you can run just a single module at a time, e.g.

  mvn -f symba-jaxb2/pom.xml test
