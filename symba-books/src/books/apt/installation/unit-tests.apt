 Unit Tests with Maven

 There are a number of unit tests already available with this STK, and more are planned. These tests are currently
 limited to the symba-mapping and symba-querying sub-projects, and can be found within that directory. Tests are
 disabled by default within the default (local) profile and within the production profile so that production databases
 are not accidentally modified with test data.

 You should run the tests <after> re-running the Maven install command with the correct profile, thus ensuring that
 the database connection details are the right ones for the test setup.

 To run the tests, simply run these commands from the top-level trunk directory (the maven install command
 just shows you the appropriate install command for the test commands below it: you do not need to run it before
 each test, unless you have modified code outside of the module whose tests you are calling):

+---+
  mvn install -Denv=val -DskipTests
  
  mvn -f symba-mapping/pom.xml test -Denv=val
  mvn -f symba-querying/pom.xml test -Denv=val
+---+

 All should pass except two (testSoftware2EquipmentLink and testSoftware2EquipmentLinkWithFlush), which are
 demonstrating a bug discovered within the auto-generated Hibernate and Spring code. Full details of this bug
 are available in the
 {{{http://galaxy.andromda.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5837}Andromda forums}}, and
 as soon as I have a fix, the unit tests should all pass.
