<p>
    Many laboratories store raw data and metadata in disparate, interconnected resources such as spreadsheets, file
    stores, local databases and lab books. While these are useful tools for a conventional approach to biological
    research, they do not meet the needs of an environment where the generation of high throughput datasets is
    commonplace. Further downstream analysis of the raw data requires data to adequately annotated and available in a
    standard format. In many cases, the researcher carrying out the analysis will not be the same person who generated
    the data. SyMBA has been developed to meet the need for a centralised raw data repository that collates and
    stores data and captures sufficient metadata in an integrated fashion to facilitate downstream analysis, export and
    publication. This help page describes how SyMBA is used to create templates and generate FuGE-ML for download.

<h2>Welcome and Creating and Account</h2>

<p>
    The main entry point for end users is a Web-based graphical user interface that displays a simplified view of the
    underlying data structure and allows upload of data and description of experimental metadata. The welcome screen is
    shown in the screenshot below. There are three main sections to the SyMBA web application which are
    named hereafter using compass directions for their position in the page. The header along the top of the page, or
    north panel, contains the SyMBA logo and name on the left, a variety of icons on the right, and the name of the
    user on the far right. The SyMBA logo will always take the user back to the welcome page. Named from left to
    right, the four icons on the right-hand side of the header are shortcuts to 'add' a new experiment,
    'view' existing experiments, 'get' data files or metadata FuGE-ML for download, and browse the
    'help' pages. If the user is not yet logged in, only the links to the welcome and help pages are active.
</p>

<p>
    To the west is the main SyMBA usage panel. Initially, the west panel contains a short summary of SyMBA and a login
    form. Once the user begins work within SyMBA, the west panel displays summaries of experiments, the experimental
    metadata and much more. The east panel is a status panel providing both contextual help and status messages. It is
    optional, and can be hidden at any time by clicking on 'Hide this panel'.
</p>

<p>
    If SyMBA is being used in a sandbox or test installation, the user may prefer to login with a pre-prepared guest
    account from the default installation of the application. This is accomplished by choosing 'Guest Account' from the
    pull-down menu of users in the west panel, and clicking Login. Otherwise, a new user may be created by clicking on
    'add new user and log in' directly to the right of the login button. The user then fills out the contact form that
    appears and clicks Save Contact. The contact is saved and the user is automatically logged in. Having a named
    account allows the stored metadata to be identified with a particular user.
</p>

<h2>Add and view buttons</h2>

<p>
    As described earlier, the right side of the north panel contains a number of quick link buttons. To quickly create a
    new investigation, clicking on the add button results in the appearance of a pop-up window as shown in the image
    below. This pop-up presents the user with three options. The first is to click on 'Add New', which will take the
    user directly to an empty investigation to begin filling in. The second is a pull-down menu of existing
    investigations. Selecting one of these and pressing the Copy button will take the user to the standard investigation
    form pre-populated with a copy of the selected investigation. Finally, the 'View Investigations' link allows the
    user to opt out of the add menu and instead view a list of existing investigations. This link works in a way
    identical to the view button from the north panel.
</p>

     alt="The pop-up window which appears when the 'add' button from the north panel of SyMBA is pressed."/>

<p>
    The view button present in the north panel takes the user to a summary of all investigations stored within SyMBA.
    The screenshot below shows an example summary page containing template, completed and standard
    investigations. Standard, modifiable investigations are shown in plain text, while read-only investigations are
    displayed in italics. Further, if an investigation is either completed or a template, this information is displayed
    in front of the investigation name. Both template and completed investigations are described in detail in the next
    section.
</p>

<p>
    As explained in the contextual help section of the east panel, the user may either click on an investigation name to
    view its details or click on the radio button next to its name and then either Copy or Delete the investigation.
    SyMBA can be modified to disable or completely remove the Delete button.

<h2>Templates and Completed Investigations</h2>

<p>
    If a user wishes to save a series of experimental steps for anyone to copy and use, a template can be created. The
    benefits of a template are
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Content standards. SyMBA templates can be built to community standards such as those present in the MIBBI
        registry.
    </li>
    <li>Conformance. If there are standard protocols for certain types of experiments within a research group, each
        protocol can get their own template in SyMBA. As each protocol is realised in a particular experiment, users can
        copy the template and fill in specific experimental details.
    </li>
    <li>Re-use. Templates make it easier to add information to experiments which are repeated multiple times. Rather
        than creating a completely new experiment description and introducing potential errors due to mistakes and
        missing information, a template can be used as many times as required to ensure the same information is filled
        in each time.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    A template can either be created from scratch or based on an existing investigation. If an existing investigation is
    to be converted to a template, a copy should be made of the investigation first. Because the conversion removes all
    links to files and marks the investigation as read-only, the copy should then be the one converted to a template.
    All other information contained within each experimental step will be retained in the template. This includes
    parameters, descriptions, names, input materials and output materials. For parameters, the name of the parameter and
    the relationship the parameter name has with its value will be marked as read-only. This means that, if the user of
    a copy of the template wishes to fill in that parameter, they must retain the name and relationship already
    provided. More information on parameters is available in the next section. Once a set of experimental steps has been
    created, saving the investigation as a template simply requires the selection of the 'Set As Template' checkbox, as
    shown in the image below.
</p>

<img src="images/symba-set-as-template.png"
     alt="The 'View Existing Investigation' screen in SyMBA. This investigation has had some experimental steps and parameters added in preparation for saving it as a template. The user has selected the 'Set As Template' checkbox. Clicking on 'Save' or 'Save and Finish' will result in this investigation being saved as a new template within SyMBA."/>

<p>
    If the description of an investigation within SyMBA has been completed and all parameters and associated metadata
    have been filled in, the investigation can be frozen, which marks it as completed and prevents further modification.
    Freezing an investigation is achieved by selecting the 'Freeze' checkbox, visible in the figure above. Italics are
    used to mark read-only investigations in the summary of experiments as shown in the 'Investigation View' screenshot
    earlier in this document.
</p>


<h2>Storing experimental metadata and data</h2>
<p>
    When a user is ready to start entering metadata and uploading data files, an existing template can be copied or a
    brand new experiment description can be created as described earlier. The act of copying or creation brings the user
    to the detailed investigation view where SyMBA users can create a new experiment, fill in information about the
    experiment and upload associated raw data files.
</p>

<p>
    The previous screenshot shows an overview of the investigation detail page. Each experimental step can have zero or
    more parameters, input materials and output materials. Parameters are structured according to a statement of three
    required and one optional attributes, as shown in the screenshot below. These attributes are structured as
    Name-Relationship-Value-Unit, with the Unit as the optional addition. In templates the Value can also be missing,
    but in standard and completed investigations the Value attribute is mandatory. At any time, parameter statements can
    be deleted. While the Name-Relationship-Value portion of the parameter statement is similar to the
    Subject-Predicate-Object of RDF triples, RDF is not used within SyMBA.
</p>

<img src="images/symba-parameter-detail.png" alt="Pop-up window allowing user input of parameters and materials."/>

<p>
    FuGE parameters have three types: number, boolean and string literal. These types can be manually specified by the
    user by selecting the appropriate radio button at the end of the parameter input line, as shown in
    the above image. However, these parameter types are relatively easy to programmatically
    ascertain, and once a Value is provided SyMBA will automatically select the radio button corresponding to its best
    guess. This selection can be overridden by the user at any time.
</p>
<p>
    Parameters are highly configurable and can be built to describe virtually any statements required by the user.
    Concentrations of reagents, types of equipment, taxonomic information and repeat numbers are just some of the vital
    pieces of experimental information which can be modelled with parameters. In theory, all materials could be included
    as parameters, but storing materials separately allows sets of commonly-used materials to be created and re-used
    across investigations.
</p>
<p>
    The name and relationship attributes within parameters are ideal candidates for restriction using ontology terms.
    Although this functionality was partly implemented in SyMBA version 1.0, it has not yet been added to version 2.0.
    For instance, OBI could be used for equipment and protocol names, while RO could be used for some of the
    relationship attributes. In future equipment will be organised as materials are now, but for now can be modelled
    using parameters.
</p>

<h2>Retrieving FuGE-ML</h2>

<p>
    SyMBA uses and manipulates Java objects built from the FuGE XSD, converting upon request between those objects and
    FuGE-ML for download and batch upload. The get button is used to view and download the metadata for a given
    investigation in FuGE-ML. Te download menu shown below is a pop-up menu which appears when the 'get' button is
    pressed, while the image after it shows a partial screenshot of the resulting FuGE-ML.
